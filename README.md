# Landmark-Detection-Model

This model is a type of ML model that enables one to detect whether the provided image of a monument is a landmark identified by Google or not.
The dataset that I have used here is from Kaggle provided by Google itself for development, learning, and research purposes. The link to the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google/google-landmarks-dataset

Also, the GitHub repo played a major role in helping me to understand how to use the dataset and to make the most out of it. The repo link is: https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark

The results which I tried to get was in the set of 4 images, each time a different set for each time we run the command,
